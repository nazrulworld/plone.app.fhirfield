Changelog
=========

1.0.0rc3 (2018-09-22)
---------------------

Improvements

- `Issue: 6 <https://github.com/nazrulworld/plone.app.fhirfield/issues/6>`_ A major improvement has been done, now very slim version (`id`, `resourceType`, `meta`) of FHIR json resource has been indexed in ZCatalog (zope index) version, however previously whole fhir resource was stored as a result now huge storage savings, perhaps improves indexing performance. [nazrulworld]


1.0.0rc2 (2018-08-29)
---------------------

Bugfixes

- Issue 5: `FHIR search's modifier 'missing' is not working for nested mapping <https://github.com/nazrulworld/plone.app.fhirfield/issues/5>`_

1.0.0rc1 (2018-08-27)
---------------------

Newfeatures

- `Identifier search parameter <http://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#token>`_ is active now (both array of identifier and single object identifier).

- Array of Reference query support (for example `basedOn` (list of reference) ) is active now. Although normal object reference has already been supported.

- All available mappings for searchable resources are generated.

- `FHIR search sort feature <https://www.hl7.org/fhir/search.html#sort>`_ is available!

- `fhirfield.es.index.mapping.nested_fields.limit`, `fhirfield.es.index.mapping.depth.limit` and `fhirfield.es.index.mapping.total_fields.limit` `registry records <https://pypi.org/project/plone.app.registry>`_ are `available to setup ES mapping <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/mapping.html#mapping-limit-settings>`_

- `URI` and `Number` type parameter based search are fully available.

- **`resourceType` filter is automatically injected into every generated query.** Query Builder knows about which resourceType should be.
